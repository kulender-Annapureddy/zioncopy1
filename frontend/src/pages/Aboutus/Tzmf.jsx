          At Zion Mission Foundation, we are fortunate to have a dedicated General 
          Secretary Mrs. Frank Leena Pulukuri whose passion for child nutrition and 
          well-being has been a driving force behind our mission for the past decade.
           As a seasoned nutritionist, she brings a wealth of expertise and a deep commitment 
           to ensuring the health and happiness of every child we serve.

             <br/>
             With a background in nutrition science and a heart filled with compassion, our General 
             Secretary has dedicated her career to improving the lives of children, particularly 
             those from underserved communities. Her work is guided by the belief that every child
              deserves access to nutritious food, quality healthcare, and a nurturing environment 
              in which to thrive.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             For the past decade, our General Secretary has been at the forefront of our

             implemented innovative nutrition programs, conducted awareness campaigns, 
             and provided essential resources to support the holistic development of children.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              But her impact goes beyond just numbers and statistics. It is in the smiles of children
               who have received nutritious meals, in the laughter of those who have regained their 
               health, and in the hope of families who see a brighter future for their children. 
               Her dedication and tireless advocacy have transformed countless lives and inspired 
               others to join us in our mission.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                to thrive, we are grateful for the leadership, expertise, and unwavering commitment
                 of our General Secretary. Her passion for child nutrition and well-being serves as
                  a guiding light, illuminating the path forward and reminding us of the
